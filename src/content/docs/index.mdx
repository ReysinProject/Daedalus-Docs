## Welcome to Daedalus

Daedalus is a powerful and flexible Python library designed to simplify the process of creating APIs. It provides a clean, modular way to integrate services, controllers, and endpoints, making it easy to build scalable and maintainable applications. With support for FastAPI and Falcon frameworks, Daedalus gives you the freedom to choose the right tool for your needs.

## Key Features

- **Framework Agnostic:** Supports FastAPI and Falcon for building APIs.
- **Modular Design:** Easily inject services into controllers using simple decorators.
- **Service Layer:** Provides a service layer to encapsulate business logic.
- **Controller Layer:** Easily define API controllers and register endpoints.
- **Routing and Endpoint Decorators:** Create routes dynamically with minimal boilerplate code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+ is required.
- Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install daedalus
```

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Application Setup:**
Create the application instance using `DaedalusFactory` and specify the module and framework (FastAPI or Falcon).

```python
from daedalus.core.factory import DaedalusFactory
from example.src.main_module import MainModule

app = DaedalusFactory(
module=MainModule,
framework='fastapi'  # or 'falcon' for Falcon
)

app.serve(
port=8000,
host='localhost',
cors=True
)
```

2. **Defining Services:**
Define your services using the `@Service` decorator. Services are responsible for business logic and can be injected into controllers.

```python
from daedalus.bootstrap.decorator.service import Service
from example.src.logger.logger_service import LoggerService

@Service()
class UserService:
inject = ['LoggerService']

    def __init__(self, logger_service: LoggerService):
        self.logger = logger_service

    def create_user(self, username):
        self.logger.log(f"User created: {username}")
```

3. **Creating Controllers:**
Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. Define endpoints using the `@Controller` decorator and the `@endpoint` decorator to specify routes.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List

from daedalus.api.decorators.endpoint import endpoint
from daedalus.api.interface.response import JanusResponse
from daedalus.bootstrap.decorator.controller import Controller
from example.src.user.user_service import UserService

@Controller()
class UserController:
inject = ['UserService']

    def __init__(self, user_service: UserService):
        self.user_service = user_service

    @endpoint(path="/user")
    def create_user_route(self, req):
        self.user_service.create_user("John Doe")
        return JanusResponse(
            status_code=200,
            data={"message": "User created"}
        )
```
