### What You'll Learn

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Install Daedalus
- Create a new project
- Understand the project structure
- Configure Daedalus

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.13+
- DaedalusCLI
- Poetry (optional, but recommended)

### Create a new project

To create a new Daedalus project, you can use the DaedalusCLI tool. This tool will generate a new project structure for you, including all the necessary files and directories to get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

```bash
daedalus new my_project
```

This will create a new directory called `my_project` with the following structure:


<FileTree>

    - README.md
    - poetry.lock
    - pyproject.toml
    - .gitignore
    - `__main__.py`
    - my_project/
        - __*main_module.py*__

</FileTree>
