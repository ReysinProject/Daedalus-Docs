##### Daedalus is a modular platform that allows you to build your own modules and use them in your projects.

We provide a __set of ready-to-use modules__ that you can use in your projects.

These modules are __designed to be used in a variety of projects and can be customized__ to fit your needs.

Each module is __independent__ and can be used in any project.

##### All the modules are open-source and available on GitHub.

You can find the source code of each module in the __Daedalus GitHub repository__
