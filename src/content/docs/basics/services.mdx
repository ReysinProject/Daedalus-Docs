A service is a class that encapsulates business logic and data access operations. Services are used to separate the business logic from the controllers, making the code more maintainable and testable.

To define a service in Daedalus, you need to create a new Python file and define a class decorated with the `@Service` decorator.

<Aside type="danger">
    The name of the service class should be unique within the application.
</Aside>

```python
from daedalus import Service

@Service()
class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_users(self):
        pass

    def create_user(self, user_data):
        pass
```

<Aside type="note">
    Services can be injected into other services and controllers using dependency injection.

<Card title="Basic Service">
    ```python
    from daedalus import Service

    @Service()
    class EmailService:
        def send_email(self, to: str, subject: str, content: str):
            # Email sending logic here
            pass
    ```

    A simple service that handles email sending functionality.

<Card title="Database Service">
    ```python
    from daedalus import Service

    @Service()
    class DatabaseService:
        def __init__(self, db_connection):
            self.db = db_connection

        def query(self, sql: str):
            return self.db.execute(sql)
    ```

    A service that manages database operations.
</Card>

<Card title="Service with Dependencies">
    ```python
    from daedalus import Service

    @Service()
    class UserNotificationService:
        def __init__(self, email_service: EmailService):
            self.email_service = email_service

        def notify_user(self, user_id: str, message: str):
            user = self.get_user(user_id)
            self.email_service.send_email(
                to=user.email,
                subject="New Notification",
                content=message
            )
    ```

    A service that depends on another service through dependency injection.
